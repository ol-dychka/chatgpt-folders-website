            Hello! I’m Alex, a junior Front-End developer based in Toronto,
            Canada. Originally from Ukraine, I moved here with my mother after
            studying Computer Science for two years at a university back home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though I couldn’t complete my degree, I continued developing my
            skills by building small projects to enhance my resume.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea for this extension came from a good friend of mine who
            noticed the lack of convenient and affordable ChatGPT organizers.
            Most were either poorly made or expensive. I set out to create a
            quality product at a reasonable price, but just before finishing,
            OpenAI announced a similar feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of letting my work go to waste, I modified the code and
            decided to release it for free. Hope you find it useful!
          </p>
